This script can export/inport all WIFI Profiles and Password.
You can use it to backup your wifi password(.txt) or all profiles (multiple .xml) before a hard reset. After you can restore all of it with 1 command "inport".
Read the ReadME to use it.

> [!WARNING]
> Set /p command not accept WiFi SSID with space/s in the name. Created command "all" to export all profiles.
